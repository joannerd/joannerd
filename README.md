### Hello! üëã

Software Engineer at [Metal]! Former [a/A] curriculum developer, concert production manager, and percussionist!

**Fun facts üê∂**
- I'm a hobbyist [photographer]
- I love playing Words with Friends (especially with [@andweeb])
- I love MapleLegends (if you play, add [GucciKimchi] and let's be friends!)
- I almost moved to Germany to study [marimba] and [percussion]

Ask me anything about `switching into tech`, `education`, `contemporary music`, or `MapleLegends`! üòÑ
