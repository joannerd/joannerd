### Hello! 👋

Software Engineer in Metal's [Proton] team! Former [a/A] curriculum developer, concert production manager, and percussionist!

**Fun facts 🐶**
- I'm a hobbyist [photographer]
- I love playing Words with Friends (especially with [@andweeb])
- I almost moved to Germany to study [marimba] and [percussion]

Ask me anything about `switching into tech`, `education`, or `contemporary music`! 😄
